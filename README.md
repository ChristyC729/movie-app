# Introduction

The objective of this project is to create a simple Movie Application. This project utilized React Native and made fetch calls at a movie API to populate the application. Two different search functions were implemented. The API has a provided search view that parses all movie information and returns matching word cases as the results. I created a separate search functionality to parse movie titles for matching characters.

### Tasks

-   Implement a React Native movie listing app
-   Build out the project to the designs inside the `/Designs` folder
-   Connect your application to the **Movie Database** at `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies`
-   For authentication pass the `"Authorization: Bearer Wookie2019"` header
-   Parse the API response and display the results as outlined in the design. **Make sure to group movies by categories**.
-   Implement a detail view for the movies in the list
-   Implement the search view by connecting to `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies?q=<search_term>`
